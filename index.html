                We are pleased to announce that the Emerging Researchers in Exoplanet Science XI (ERES XI) conference will be held at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor on July 27–28, 2026. 
                Much thanks to the Center for Habitable Planetary Systems for funding this conference.
                <p>
                <p>The ERES annual meeting provides a platform for early-career scientists—graduate students, postdocs, and advanced undergraduates—to share their research on all aspects of exoplanet science, from detection and characterization to theory and instrumentation. The meeting also fosters networking, collaboration, and professional development within the exoplanet community.
                
                <p style="color: white; font-weight: bold;">
                If you are interested in attending, please fill out our interest form here:
                <a href="https://forms.gle/SDgQDaXibWHfCCxN6" style="color: white; font-weight: bold;">

                <span style="font-weight: normal; color: inherit;">
                    This will help us stay in touch and provide updates as abstract submission, registration,
                    and travel information become available. We anticipate a call for abstracts in March. 
                </span>
                </p>
        
                <p>We look forward to welcoming the exoplanet community to Ann Arbor this summer for two days of exciting research and discussion!

            <!-- Frequently Asked Questions -->

              <div class="inner">
                <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

                <h3>What is ERES?</h3>
                <p>ERES is an annual conference by and for early-career scientists
                (e.g. graduate students, postdocs, postbacs, advanced
                undergraduates) working in planetary astronomy, Earth sciences,
                the search for life in the cosmos, and related fields. Its
                purpose is to provide an opportunity for these researchers to
                present their research to an interested audience and network
                with peers, as well as to stimulate collaborations among
                exoplanet, Solar System, and Earth science researchers.</p>
                <p>ERES has been held annually on a rotating basis between partner
                institutions since 2015. The current partner institutions are
                Cornell, Penn State, Princeton, and Yale.
                </p>

                <h3>What are the formats of the talks and posters for ERES?</h3>
                <p>Talks have been 8 minutes long with 2 minutes for questions
                (10 total). Posterboards have been 4 feet wide by 4 feet
                tall.</p>

                <h3>I don't study exoplanets. Can I participate in ERES?</h3>
                <p>ERES is open to all early-career scientists, researchers, and
                students working on anything related to planets and planetary
                systems, broadly construed. In addition to exoplanets, relevant
                areas of research may include (but are not limited to) star and
                planet formation and evolution (including disks); stellar
                astrophysics; planetary science and Solar System exploration;
                astrobiology and the search for life beyond Earth; geological,
                oceanic, and atmospheric sciences; celestial mechanics and
                astrodynamics; and aerospace engineering. </p>

                <h3>Can I register/participate without submitting an abstract?</h3>
                <p>Yes. However, we strongly encourage submitting an abstract if
                you can. We will not be able to provide lodgings or travel
                support for participants who do not submit abstracts.</p>

                <h3>Is there a virtual/remote attendance option?</h3>
                <p>TBD. Previously, ERES X was a fully in-person event. </p>

                <h3>How many slots are there for oral presentations? What about poster presentations?</h3>
                <p>The SOC will decide the number of talks on the schedule after
                abstracts have been received, sorted, and reviewed. We
                anticipate that everyone who submits a reasonable, relevant
                abstract will be offered an opportunity to present at the
                conference.</p>

                <h3>What will be the costs of attending?</h3>
                <p>Due to the unprecedented current fiscal situation in the US,
                ERES XI is working with a limited budget compared to previous
                years. Nevertheless, we will make every effort to ensure that
                participants are supported as much as possible.

                <p>With the generous contributions from the Center for Habitable Planetary Systems, 
                we are able to guarantee free registration for all participants. 
                </p>
            

                <h3>How do you pronouce ERES?</h3>
                <p>We are going with the pronunciation "EE-rez" (IPA spelling:
                /'ir&#603;z/). Some of us who were around for ERES V in 2019
                remember it being pronounced "AIR-eez" (/&#603;&#601;ri:z/, like
                the name "Ares").</p>
