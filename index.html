                <h2>About ERES</h2>
                <p>
                The tenth Emerging Researchers in Exoplanet Science Symposium
                (ERES X) will take place 2025 June 16-17 at Princeton University
                in Princeton, New Jersey.
                </p>
                <p>
                ERES is an annual conference by and for early-career scientists
                (e.g. graduate students, postdocs, postbacs, advanced
                undergraduates) working in planetary astronomy, Earth sciences,
                the search for life in the cosmos, and related fields. Its
                purpose is to provide an opportunity for these researchers to
                present their research to an interested audience and network
                with peers, as well as to stimulate collaborations among
                exoplanet, Solar System, and Earth science researchers.
                </p>
                <p>
                ERES has been held annually on a rotating basis between partner
                institutions since 2015. The current partner institutions are
                Cornell, Penn State, Princeton, and Yale.
                </p>

                <h2>Logistics</h2>
                Note that a more comprehensive packet containing this
                information will be available by early June.
                <h3>Getting here</h3>
                First, get to Princeton Junction:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                    For those taking the train, Amtrak stops at Princeton Junction.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                    For all other modes of transportation, it is hopefully helpful
                    to know that NJ Transit runs from Penn Station, NY to Princeton
                    Junction.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                    For those flying, Newark Liberty International Airport is
                    connected to Princeton Junction via NJ Transit (follow signs for
                    "Airtrain").
                    </li>
                </ul>

                For those worried about the ongoing flight delays at Newark and
                the recent strike at NJ Transit (which ended as of May 19), we
                cannot provide official guidance. However, the Philadelphia
                airport is only moderately more inconvenient than Newark
                (requiring an additional transfer at Trenton) and is an
                alternative option.
                <p>
                Once you get to Princeton Junction, take the "Dinky" to
                Princeton Station, which is then a 5-10 minute walk from
                <a href=https://maps.app.goo.gl/Az15inxHu1ToTZc18>
                    Bloomberg Hall</a>,
                where we will house most attendees.
                </p>
                <h3>Staying here</h3>
                <p>
                For those provided housing support, you will be housed at
                <a href=https://maps.app.goo.gl/Az15inxHu1ToTZc18>
                    Bloomberg Hall</a> for up to two nights, June 15 and 16.
                Guests will be booked in single-occupancy rooms.
                </p>

                <p>
                For those independently traveling,
                <a href=https://maps.app.goo.gl/h7qXimAShfm1dPi47>
                    Nassau Inn</a>
                and the
                <a href=https://maps.app.goo.gl/AshWtvg3pwPr7CPN9>
                    Graduate Hotel</a>
                are pricier options that are walking distance from the
                conference venue at

                    Jadwin Hall</a>.
                Other hotels that are somewhat further are located on Highway 1
                (~ 40 minute walk, driving encouraged):

                    Princeton</a>

            <!-- Frequently Asked Questions -->
            <section id="faq" class="wrapper style2 fade-up">
              <div class="inner">
                <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
                    <h3>I don't study exoplanets. Can I participate in ERES?</h3>
                <p>ERES is open to all early-career scientists, researchers, and
                students working on anything related to planets and planetary
                systems, broadly construed. In addition to exoplanets, relevant
                areas of research may include (but are not limited to) star and
                planet formation and evolution (including disks); stellar
                astrophysics; planetary science and Solar System exploration;
                astrobiology and the search for life beyond Earth; geological,
                oceanic, and atmospheric sciences; celestial mechanics and
                astrodynamics; and aerospace engineering. </p>

                <h3>Can I register/participate without submitting an abstract?</h3>
                <p>Yes. However, we strongly encourage submitting an abstract if
                you can. We will not be able to provide lodgings or travel
                support for participants who do not submit abstracts.</p>

                <h3>Is there a virtual/remote attendance option?</h3>
                <p>No. ERES X will be a fully in-person event. </p>

                <h3>How many slots are there for oral presentations? What about poster presentations?</h3>
                <p>The SOC will decide the number of talks on the schedule after
                abstracts have been received, sorted, and reviewed. We
                anticipate that everyone who submits a reasonable, relevant
                abstract will be offered an opportunity to present at the
                conference.</p>

                <h3>What will be the costs of attending?</h3>
                <p>Due to the unprecedented current fiscal situation in the US,
                ERES X is working with a limited budget compared to previous
                years. Nevertheless, we have made every effort to ensure that
                participants are supported as much as possible.
                </p>
                <p>
                Our tentative financial plan is as follows:
                Registration and abstract submission is free of charge for all
                participants.
                Breakfast and lunch will be catered by Princeton Campus Dining
                at no cost to attendees.
                We currently expect to ask attendees to organize their own
                dinners (options on campus start around $10-$20).
                Housing financial support will be limited and prioritized for
                researchers otherwise unable to attend.
                Travel support is currently outside the scope of our budget.
                </p>

                <h3>How do you pronouce ERES?</h3>
                <p>We are going with the pronunciation "EE-rez" (IPA spelling:
                /'ir&#603;z/). Some of us who were around for ERES V in 2019
                remember it being pronounced "AIR-eez" (/&#603;&#601;ri:z/, like
                the name "Ares").</p>
